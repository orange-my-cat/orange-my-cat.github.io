# personal site with hugo and tailwind!

### why hugo and tailwind?

I tried using Jekyll for my personal site previously because it has built-in support for GitHub Pages but changed it to Hugo. Hugo builds quicker and is easier to use compared to Jekyll.

I also changed from Bootstrap to Tailwind as it allows more customization of the website and prevents it from looking like all the other Bootstrap websites out there.

### try to make one yourself!

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
2. Create your website with `hugo new site sitename`.
3. Start coding!
4. Run the site with `hugo serve`.
