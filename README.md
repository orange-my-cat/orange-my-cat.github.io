# personal site with hugo and tailwind!

### why hugo and tailwind?

Previously, I used Jekyll for my personal site because it integrates well with GitHub Pages but changed it to Hugo for the current implementation. Hugo feels faster and allows me to code and view changes at the same time without needing me to rebuild the site.

I also changed from Bootstrap to Tailwind as it allows more customization of the website and prevents it from looking like all the other Bootstrap websites out there.

### try to make one yourself!

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
2. Create your website with `hugo new site sitename`.
3. Create your theme with `hugo new theme themename`.
4. Start coding!
