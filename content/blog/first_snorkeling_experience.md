Recently, I joined [StudyPerth](https://www.studyperth.com.au/) for a snorkeling day trip. I had always wanted to try diving or snorkeling in the ocean. Just because I like pretty things. But I also had a [fear of the deep sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia). Anyways, I decided to join as participation fees were quite cheap and there were professionals around to guide the group.

Early in the morning, everyone gathered at StudyPerth Student Hub for an attendance check. Soon after, we departed to [Coogee Beach](https://www.cockburn.wa.gov.au/Recreation-and-Attractions/Trails-Tracks-and-Lookouts/Coogee-Maritime-Trail), where Omeo Wreck is at. After arriving, we had a briefing by the [Perth Ocean Diving](https://www.perthocean.com/) team. They taught us how to use snorkels and what we should do during the session. Everyone was given their own snorkels and swimfins, and were headed to the beach. Like everyone else, I put on some sunscreen and started going towards the beach.

In the morning, with only slow winds, the waters were calm. I spit on my goggles to avoid fogging and put them on. After walking towards deeper waters, I put on my swimfins as well. I put on my snorkel and placed my face underwater. It felt, weird. Visibility was not as good as I expected because I always thought we could see crystal clear underwater. I put my feet up and started swimming, but I didn't know where I was going lol. So every few seconds I raised my head up to see where I was. The sea was deeper than I thought because images I found online made it look shallow.

To be honest, it was my first time swimming in more than 6 months, I was quite nervous, but I managed to swim well. Swimming towards deeper parts of the beach, it felt awesome. I could see schools of tiny fishes around, and also parts of the shipwreck that were under water. For a first-time snorkeler it was just overwhelming. It is hard to describe how it feels to see what is happening under water â€“ it is like entering and exploring an unknown world. Parts of the shipwreck looked scary as it was covered in moss and aquatic life. And when I swam over the wreck I got really close to parts of it and became quite anxious.

However, a bit later in the day winds started to pick up, so did the waves. The waves easily went over my snorkel. As I underestimated the power of the waves, I wanted to go for another round around the shipwreck. Halfway there, a wave flooded my snorkel and I started choking on seawater. I panicked for a bit as it was quite deep and my feet couldn't reach the ground. But I kept calm and luckily I managed to swim back to the shore while holding my breath. I stopped going in the water when the waves wouldn't subside.

Overall, it was a fun and scary new experience for me.
