I've always wanted to try diving or snorkeling in the ocean. I like pretty things and I've seen pictures of the beautiful underwater world. But I also had quite a bit of [fear towards the deep sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia). So recently, I decided to join [StudyPerth](https://www.studyperth.com.au/) for a snorkeling day trip to face my fears and experience something new.

Early in the morning, we gathered at StudyPerth Student Hub for an attendance check. Soon after, we departed to [Coogee Beach](https://www.cockburn.wa.gov.au/Recreation-and-Attractions/Trails-Tracks-and-Lookouts/Coogee-Maritime-Trail), where Omeo Wreck is located. Upon arrival, we had a briefing by the [Perth Ocean Diving](https://www.perthocean.com/) team. They taught us how to use snorkels and what we should do during the session. Everyone was given their own snorkels and swimfins and we headed to the beach.

In the morning, with only slow winds, the waters were calm. I put on some sunscreen and put on my goggles. I walked towards deeper waters and put on my swimfins. As a first-time snorkeler, it felt weird to place my face underwater. The visibility was not as good as I expected, but I could still see schools of tiny fishes around and parts of the shipwreck that were underwater. Swimming towards deeper parts of the beach was an awesome experience. I felt like I was exploring an unknown world.

However, a bit later in the day, the winds started to pick up and so did the waves. The waves easily went over my snorkel and I started choking on seawater. I panicked for a bit, but I managed to stay calm and swim back to the shore while holding my breath.

Overall, it was a fun and scary new experience for me. It was my first time swimming in more than 6 months and I was quite nervous, but I managed to swim well. I had a great time seeing what's happening underwater, but I also realized that the deep sea can be quite scary. Snorkeling allowed me to overcome my fear and experience something new.
