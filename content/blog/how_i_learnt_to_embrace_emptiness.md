Have you ever found yourself wondering why you're writing something? Or questioning your ability to write at all? Do you feel like you have nothing to write about, or that you're not sure why you even want to write in the first place? These thoughts, combined with a feeling of emptiness, are something I've experienced more than a few times in my life.

Emptiness can be characterized by emotional numbness, a lack of purpose and meaning, feeling disconnected, and acting mechanically or without enthusiasm. For me, it often comes on when something in my life has changed. For example, I recently went through a tough breakup that left me feeling lost and disconnected from myself. Despite having family and friends, I felt like nothing in my life had real meaning or significance.

But why does emptiness happen? As someone who doesn't constantly feel empty, I believe it often occurs after a significant life event or change. It can be easy to lose touch with ourselves when our daily routines are disrupted, or when we're no longer surrounded by people who support us.

However, feeling empty doesn't have to be a negative thing. It can serve as a checkpoint in our lives, prompting us to reflect on where we're headed and what we truly want out of life. In order to rediscover myself and find meaning in my life again, I started doing things that brought me joy and writing down my goals. It wasn't easy, and even this short article took me 3 days to write lol. So look forward to my stories!

Learning to embrace emptiness and use it as a tool for growth can be challenging, but it's possible. Take time to plan out your next steps, try new things, and don't be afraid to relax and reflect on your goals. Remember, it's okay to not always have something to do or someone to talk to. Use that time to think about what you really want out of life, and whether the things you currently have align with those desires.

In the end, finding happiness and fulfillment in life is what matters most. Don't be afraid to prioritize your own well-being and do what makes you happy, even if it means taking a break from writing or other activities for a while. And remember, being bad at something now doesn't mean you'll always be bad at it in the future. So keep going, and don't give up on yourself.
