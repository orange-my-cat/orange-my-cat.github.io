“We become what we behold.” - [Marshall McLuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan).

Everyone in this world has their own set of beliefs. The things we see and experience around us shape our thoughts, actions, and perceptions. We begin to build our views and values as children, based on the lessons of our parents, society, and culture. Our interactions with those around us strengthen our beliefs even more. We witness their acts and views, and we subconsciously adopt them as our own. This is how we become the things we see.

Similarly, our beliefs affect our surroundings. We usually seek out people and places that share our views and values, and as a result, we build our own tiny universe that represents our principles. However, this could cause us to become closed-minded towards others who have different opinions. We reject things without allowing the opportunity for clarifications. This is how discrimination and prejudice is formed.

To change this, I think it is important to approach the world with an open mind. By setting aside our preconceptions and be willing to learn without relying on prior knowledge, we can broaden our perspectives and become more understanding towards others. As [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus) once said, "It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows." We must be willing to challenge our beliefs and be open to new ideas in order to truly grow and learn.

Recently, I made a personal decision to see the world without relying on my previous beliefs. By approaching people and experiences without bias and bigotry. For me, it was a challenging feat as I grew up in a conservative environment, and my beliefs were heavily influenced by my upbringing. It is not easy to break free from one's own preconceptions. But like the title of my article, I wanted to learn and understand the world more by having different perspectives.

Up till now, I think that being open-minded has helped me in many aspects of my life. It has encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and try new experiences that I may have otherwise avoided. Whether it's trying a new food, visiting a new place, or learning a new skill, each new experience has broadened my perspective and helped me better understand the world. It has also enabled me to build better relationships with people from different backgrounds, and has enabled me to appreciate the diversity of human thought, behavior, and the complexity of the world we live in.
