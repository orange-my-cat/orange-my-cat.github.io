What am I writing this for? Why do I even want to write anything? I don't have anything to write about. Can I even write? I have so much else I can do, why should I write? What else can I do? And why should I even do anything? Why did I do everything in the first place?

This was what I thought before I changed the title of this article and deleted everything I wrote. I call these thoughts combined with what I'm feeling: emptiness. I've felt emptiness more than a few times throughout my life.

Emotional numbness, lack of purpose and meaning, acting mechanically, feeling worthless and disconnected are textbook symptoms of feeling empty. And of course, most of it occur to me when I feel empty. I can describe it as feeling like I have everything I could want, but nothing I would want. Or rather feeling like you have nothing in your life with meaning, despite having lots of important things such as family and friends.
