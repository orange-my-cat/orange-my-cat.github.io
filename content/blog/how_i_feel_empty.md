What am I writing this for? Why do I even want to write anything? I don't have anything to write about. Can I even write? I have so much else I can do, why should I write? But what else can I do? And why should I even do anything? Why did I do everything in the first place? These were my thoughts before I deleted everything I wrote and started over. I call these thoughts combined with what I'm feeling: emptiness. I've felt emptiness more than a few times throughout my life.

Emotional numbness, lack of purpose and meaning, acting mechanically, feeling worthless and disconnected are textbook symptoms of feeling empty. And of course, most of it happens to me when I feel empty too. I can describe it as feeling like I have everything I could want, but nothing I would want. Or rather feeling like you have nothing in your life with meaning, despite having lots of important things such as family and friends.

Why does it happen then? As a person that doesn't feel empty constantly, only occasionally, I would say that this usually happens when something in life has changed. Like recently, I went through a tough breakup, it wasn't anyone's fault but I guess shit just kinda happens. And this resulted in a huge change in how I live my daily life. From having someone to talk to everyday to just being alone. Perhaps this relationship made me lose touch with myself.

I was living so well all along that I forgot for what and why am I living for, but I didn't want to stay like this. So, in order to find myself back, I tried doing different things, I tried improving myself in chase of what I wanted in life. I started doing what I enjoyed, and I also started writing down my goals and working on achieving them. Being bad now doesn't mean I'll be bad in the future, even this short article took me 3 days to write lol. So look forward to my stories!

Feelings of emptiness are like checkpoints in our lives. Where to next? We don't know. Take time to plan it out, try different things, relax. Learn to embrace the emptiness, there's no need to have something all the time. Use the emptiness to reconsider where you want to go. Is what you have really what you want? Ya know, people would usually watch an entire series even when the first episode sucked just because someone told them that it gets better. But that's just what someone else thinks, think for yourself.

In the end, being happy in life is what's important to me, more than any other things, call me selfish but, just chill.
