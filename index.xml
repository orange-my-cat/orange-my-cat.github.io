A LLaMa however, is a foundational large langauge model released by Meta.
AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard has been gaining popularity lately, and as a science student, of course I would want to learn about their behind the scenes tech stuff. Although LLaMa may seem similar to ChatGPT and Bard, it is in fact quite different. While ChatGPT and Bard is an entire usable application, LLaMa is just the brains behind AI applications.</description></item><item><title>Collecting Lenses to See the World</title><link>https://orange-my-cat.github.io/blog/collecting_lenses_to_see_the_world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://orange-my-cat.github.io/blog/collecting_lenses_to_see_the_world/</guid><description>“We become what we behold.” - Marshall McLuhan.
Everyone in this world has their own set of beliefs. The things we see and experience around us shape our thoughts, actions, and perceptions. We begin to build our views and values as children, based on the lessons of our parents, society, and culture. Our interactions with those around us strengthen our beliefs even more. We witness their acts and views, and we subconsciously adopt them as our own.</description></item><item><title>Western Australian Debating League</title><link>https://orange-my-cat.github.io/projects/wadl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://orange-my-cat.github.io/projects/wadl/</guid><description>A progressive web-application to assist the Western Australia Debating League with their seasonal organisation needs.

Seeking answers, I pursued a second major in Mathematics and Statistics in my university.
The study dates back to 1858, when mathematician Arthur Cayley made a groundbreaking discovery with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. This theorem states that if λ (the eigenvalue) is substituted with the original matrix, the characteristic polynomial for a matrix will remain true.</description></item><item><title>Why Happily Ever Afters Doesn't Exist</title><link>https://orange-my-cat.github.io/blog/why_happily_ever_afters_doesnt_exist/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://orange-my-cat.github.io/blog/why_happily_ever_afters_doesnt_exist/</guid><description>In 1978, researchers at Northwestern University and the University of Massachusetts asked recent Illinois State Lottery winners whose prizes ranged from $50,000 to $1 million, as well as recent victims of catastrophic accidents who were now paraplegic or quadriplegic, about their happiness. The two groups were asked to rate their level of enjoyment from everyday activities such as talking to friends, watching TV, eating breakfast, laughing at a joke, or receiving a compliment.</description></item><item><title>First Snorkeling Day Trip</title><link>https://orange-my-cat.github.io/blog/first_snorkeling_day_trip/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://orange-my-cat.github.io/blog/first_snorkeling_day_trip/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try diving or snorkeling in the ocean. I like pretty things and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen pictures of the beautiful underwater world. But I also had quite a bit of fear towards the deep sea. So recently, I decided to join StudyPerth for a snorkeling day trip to face my fears and experience something new.
Early in the morning, we gathered at StudyPerth Student Hub for an attendance check.</description></item></channel></rss>
