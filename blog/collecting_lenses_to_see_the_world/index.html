href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan>Marshall McLuhan</a>.</p><p>Everyone in this world has their own set of beliefs. The things we see and experience around us shape our thoughts, actions, and perceptions. We begin to build our views and values as children, based on the lessons of our parents, society, and culture. Our interactions with those around us strengthen our beliefs even more. We witness their acts and views, and we subconsciously adopt them as our own. This is how we become the things we see.</p><p>Similarly, our beliefs affect our surroundings. We usually seek out people and places that share our views and values, and as a result, we build our own tiny universe that represents our principles. However, this could cause us to become closed-minded towards others who have different opinions. We reject things without allowing the opportunity for clarifications. This is how discrimination and prejudice is formed.</p><p>To change this, I think it is important to approach the world with an open mind. By setting aside our preconceptions and be willing to learn without relying on prior knowledge, we can broaden our perspectives and become more understanding towards others. As <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus>Epictetus</a> once said, &ldquo;It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.&rdquo; We must be willing to challenge our beliefs and be open to new ideas in order to truly grow and learn.</p><p>Recently, I made a personal decision to see the world without relying on my previous beliefs. By approaching people and experiences without bias and bigotry. For me, it was a challenging feat as I grew up in a conservative environment, and my beliefs were heavily influenced by my upbringing. It is not easy to break free from one&rsquo;s own preconceptions. But like the title of my article, I wanted to learn and understand the world more by having different perspectives.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a famous story called the flea in a jar experiment. In the experiment, when a number of fleas is placed in a glass jar, they quickly jumped out. But when the fleas were put back into the jar and closed with glass lid, they began jumping and hitting the glass lid, falling back down into the jar. After a while, the fleas were conditioned to the presence of the glass lid, began jumping slightly below the glass lid so as not to hit it. When the glass lid was removed, the fleas were no longer jumping out of the jar. The fleas have learned to limit themselves from jumping beyond the height of the lid even if the lid was removed as they have been conditioned to the fact that they cannot escape from the jar. This is similar to how we create paradigms in our lives and end up limiting our potential.</p><p>Up till now, I think that being open-minded has helped me in many aspects of my life. It has encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and try new experiences that I may have otherwise avoided. Whether it&rsquo;s trying a new food, visiting a new place, or learning a new skill, each new experience has broadened my perspective and helped me better understand the world. It has also enabled me to build better relationships with people from different backgrounds, and has helped me appreciate the diversity of human thought, behavior, and the complexity of the world we live in.</p></article></div><footer class="mx-4 lg:ml-56 lg:mr-40 relative"><br><hr class=border-gray-300><br><div class=text-center style=font-family:quicksand,sans-serif><p><a href=https://github.com/orange-my-cat class="underline hover:text-red-600 transition-colors duration-300">github</a>
