for? Why do I even want to write anything? I don&rsquo;t have anything to write about. Can I even write? I have so much else I can do, why should I write? But what else can I do? And why should I even do anything? Why did I do everything in the first place? These were my thoughts before I deleted everything I wrote and started over. I call these thoughts combined with what I&rsquo;m feeling: emptiness. I&rsquo;ve felt emptiness more than a few times throughout my life.</p><p>Emotional numbness, lack of purpose and meaning, acting mechanically, feeling worthless and disconnected are textbook symptoms of feeling empty. And of course, most of it happens to me when I feel empty too. I can describe it as feeling like I have everything I could want, but nothing I would want. Or rather feeling like you have nothing in your life with meaning, despite having lots of important things such as family and friends.</p><p>Why does it happen then? As a person that doesn&rsquo;t feel empty frequently in my life, I would say that this usually happens when something in life has changed. Like recently, I went through a tough breakup, it wasn&rsquo;t anyone&rsquo;s fault but I guess shit just kinda happens. And this resulted in a huge change in how I live my daily life. From having someone to talk to everyday to just being alone. Perhaps this relationship made me lose touch with myself.</p><p>I was living so well all along that I forgot for what and why am I living for, but I didn&rsquo;t want to stay like this. So, in order to find myself back, I tried doing different things, I tried improving myself in chase of what I wanted in life. I started doing what I enjoyed, and I also started writing down my goals and working on achieving them. Being bad now doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll be bad in the future, even this short article took me 3 days to write lol. So look forward to my stories!</p><p>In the end, being happy in life is what&rsquo;s important to me, more than any other things, call me selfish but, just chill.</p><p><img src=/blogs/chill.png alt="dead inside meme"></p></article></div></div><footer></footer></body></html>
