I had always wanted to try diving or snorkeling in the ocean. Just because I like pretty things. But I also had a fear of the deep sea. Anyways, I decided to join as participation fees were quite cheap and there were professionals around to guide the group.
Early in the morning, everyone gathered at StudyPerth Student Hub for an attendance check.</description></item></channel></rss>
